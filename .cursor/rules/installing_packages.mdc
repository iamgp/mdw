When installing libraries in Python, do not rely solely on your own knowledge or outdated resources.

Your knowledge may have a cut-off date, and you might not be aware of all the latest developments in the Python ecosystem.

This means that instead of picking a version manually (via updating the `pyproject.toml` file), you should use uv to install it:

`uv add my-package`
